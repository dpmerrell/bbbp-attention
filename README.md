# bbbp-attention

Deep learning exercise: build an attention-based model to predict whether a molecule can permeate the blood-brain barrier.

Key highlights:

* I use the BBBP dataset curated by [MoleculeNet](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1).
* The molecules are encoded in terms of atoms (one-hot), bonds (thermometer), graph topology (adjacency matrix), and geometry (pairwise distance matrix).
* The data is split by molecular scaffold. However, there are some differences between my splits and those generated by DeepChem.
* The model consists mostly of self-attention layers. The final layer is a multiplicative attention layer that "pays attention" to atoms.
* Hyperparameters are tuned via grid search.
* The test set AUCROC is quite high -- but I wouldn't compare it against the [MoleculeNet leaderboard](https://github.com/deepchem/moleculenet#bbbp), due to differences between our splits.

See the `bbbp-exercise.ipynb` for the full explanation, code, and analysis.

I provide all of my python dependencies in `requires.txt`. Install via `pip`:

`$ pip install -r requires.txt`
